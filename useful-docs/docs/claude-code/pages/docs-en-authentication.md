Claude Code supports multiple authentication methods depending on your setup. Individual users can log in with a Claude.ai account, while teams can use Claude for Teams or Enterprise, the Claude Console, or a cloud provider like Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry.

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication\#log-in-to-claude-code)  Log in to Claude Code

After [installing Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup#install-claude-code), run `claude` in your terminal. On first launch, Claude Code opens a browser window for you to log in.If the browser doesn’t open automatically, press `c` to copy the login URL to your clipboard, then paste it into your browser.You can authenticate with any of these account types:

- **Claude Pro or Max subscription**: log in with your Claude.ai account. Subscribe at [claude.com/pricing](https://claude.com/pricing?utm_source=claude_code&utm_medium=docs&utm_content=authentication_pro_max).
- **Claude for Teams or Enterprise**: log in with the Claude.ai account your team admin invited you to.
- **Claude Console**: log in with your Console credentials. Your admin must have [invited you](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication#claude-console-authentication) first.
- **Cloud providers**: if your organization uses [Amazon Bedrock](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/amazon-bedrock), [Google Vertex AI](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/google-vertex-ai), or [Microsoft Foundry](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/microsoft-foundry), set the required environment variables before running `claude`. No browser login is needed.

To log out and re-authenticate, type `/logout` at the Claude Code prompt.If you’re having trouble logging in, see [authentication troubleshooting](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting#authentication-issues).

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication\#set-up-team-authentication)  Set up team authentication

For teams and organizations, you can configure Claude Code access in one of these ways:

- [Claude for Teams or Enterprise](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication#claude-for-teams-or-enterprise), recommended for most teams
- [Claude Console](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication#claude-console-authentication)
- [Amazon Bedrock](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/amazon-bedrock)
- [Google Vertex AI](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/google-vertex-ai)
- [Microsoft Foundry](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/microsoft-foundry)

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication\#claude-for-teams-or-enterprise)  Claude for Teams or Enterprise

[Claude for Teams](https://claude.com/pricing?utm_source=claude_code&utm_medium=docs&utm_content=authentication_teams#team-&-enterprise) and [Claude for Enterprise](https://anthropic.com/contact-sales?utm_source=claude_code&utm_medium=docs&utm_content=authentication_enterprise) provide the best experience for organizations using Claude Code. Team members get access to both Claude Code and Claude on the web with centralized billing and team management.

- **Claude for Teams**: self-service plan with collaboration features, admin tools, and billing management. Best for smaller teams.
- **Claude for Enterprise**: adds SSO, domain capture, role-based permissions, compliance API, and managed policy settings for organization-wide Claude Code configurations. Best for larger organizations with security and compliance requirements.

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication\#credential-management)  Credential management

Claude Code securely manages your authentication credentials:

- **Storage location**: on macOS, credentials are stored in the encrypted macOS Keychain. On Linux and Windows, credentials are stored in `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, or under `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` if that variable is set. On Linux, the file is written with mode `0600`; on Windows, it inherits the access controls of your user profile directory.
- **Supported authentication types**: Claude.ai credentials, Claude API credentials, Azure Auth, Bedrock Auth, and Vertex Auth.
- **Custom credential scripts**: the [`apiKeyHelper`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#available-settings) setting can be configured to run a shell script that returns an API key.
- **Refresh intervals**: by default, `apiKeyHelper` is called after 5 minutes or on HTTP 401 response. Set `CLAUDE_CODE_API_KEY_HELPER_TTL_MS` environment variable for custom refresh intervals.
- **Slow helper notice**: if `apiKeyHelper` takes longer than 10 seconds to return a key, Claude Code displays a warning notice in the prompt bar showing the elapsed time. If you see this notice regularly, check whether your credential script can be optimized.

`apiKeyHelper`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` apply to terminal CLI sessions only. Claude Desktop and remote sessions use OAuth exclusively and do not call `apiKeyHelper` or read API key environment variables.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication\#authentication-precedence)  Authentication precedence

When multiple credentials are present, Claude Code chooses one in this order:

1. Cloud provider credentials, when `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX`, or `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY` is set. See [third-party integrations](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/third-party-integrations) for setup.
2. `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable. Sent as the `Authorization: Bearer` header. Use this when routing through an [LLM gateway or proxy](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/llm-gateway) that authenticates with bearer tokens rather than Anthropic API keys.
3. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable. Sent as the `X-Api-Key` header. Use this for direct Anthropic API access with a key from the [Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com/). In interactive mode, you are prompted once to approve or decline the key, and your choice is remembered. To change it later, use the “Use custom API key” toggle in `/config`. In non-interactive mode (`-p`), the key is always used when present.
4. [`apiKeyHelper`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#available-settings) script output. Use this for dynamic or rotating credentials, such as short-lived tokens fetched from a vault.
5. Subscription OAuth credentials from `/login`. This is the default for Claude Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise users.

If you have an active Claude subscription but also have `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set in your environment, the API key takes precedence once approved. This can cause authentication failures if the key belongs to a disabled or expired organization. Run `unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to fall back to your subscription, and check `/status` to confirm which method is active.[Claude Code on the Web](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web) always uses your subscription credentials. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` in the sandbox environment do not override them.
