Built-in commands

[Getting started](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) [Build with Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) [Deployment](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/third-party-integrations) [Administration](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup) [Configuration](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings) [Reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference) [Resources](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/legal-and-compliance)

Type `/` in Claude Code to see all available commands, or type `/` followed by any letters to filter. Not all commands are visible to every user. Some depend on your platform, plan, or environment. For example, `/desktop` only appears on macOS and Windows, `/upgrade` and `/privacy-settings` are only available on Pro and Max plans, and `/terminal-setup` is hidden when your terminal natively supports its keybindings.Claude Code also includes [bundled skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills#bundled-skills) like `/simplify`, `/batch`, `/debug`, and `/loop` that appear alongside built-in commands when you type `/`. To create your own commands, see [skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills).In the table below, `<arg>` indicates a required argument and `[arg]` indicates an optional one.

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/commands\#mcp-prompts)  MCP prompts

MCP servers can expose prompts that appear as commands. These use the format `/mcp__<server>__<prompt>` and are dynamically discovered from connected servers. See [MCP prompts](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp#use-mcp-prompts-as-commands) for details.
